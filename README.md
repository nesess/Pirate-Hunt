# Pirate-Hunt
A 3d sea battle game with pirate ships.

  In this game i tried to implement general io-like game mechanichs to sea battle game. The simple explanation of my game is earning upgrade points via destroying other ships and boxes. With this upgrade points you can upgrade your ship features and ship tier.
